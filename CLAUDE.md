## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

### Room-code namespaces (DESIGN.md §39.4/§39.6)

Leaf types share a first character across three namespaces:

- **`C` / `O` / `S`** — generic structural types (circulation / outside / sahn),
  uppercase, reserved. A programme code spelled exactly one of these is rejected
  at load.
- **programme room codes** — lowercase, may start with *any* letter. The generic
  tests match `C`/`O`/`S` exactly, so `cr1` is a room, not circulation.
- **`usage:`** — every space declares its access-requirement class
  (`living`/`kitchen`/`bedroom`/`toilet`/`utility`/`none`), mandatory, no
  fallback (DESIGN.md §39.7). A code's spelling decides nothing: `name:` is free
  text, `usage:` drives behaviour. There is no first-character type test left
  anywhere in the codebase.

When adding or editing a programme, run
`python experiments/audit_programme_config.py` — it reports reserved-name
collisions, the usage class each code picks up, and per-room-spec satisfiability.

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```

   **`origin` is GitHub, and GitHub is the default.** Everything — this
   workflow, the cold-start runner, agent containers — pushes to
   `github.com/brunopostle/homemaker-layout` and nowhere else. That is the
   record.

   `hub.postle.net:bruno/homemaker-layout.git` is the owner's own server, kept
   as a **separate, occasional** remote named `hub`. It is a mirror, not a
   second source of truth, and it is pushed by hand when the owner wants a copy
   there:

   ```bash
   git remote add hub hub.postle.net:bruno/homemaker-layout.git  # once per clone
   git push hub <branch>                                          # occasionally
   ```

   Never make `hub` an alias or a second push URL of `origin`. That was tried
   and it is how the two drifted a week apart in September 2026: the runner
   pushed results to one host while an agent polled the other and reported,
   truthfully from where it stood, that nothing had arrived. Two hosts answering
   to one name is the failure mode. Keep the names distinct and `hub` gets
   whatever GitHub has, whenever you send it.

   Agent containers have no `ssh` binary, so they cannot reach `hub` at all —
   another reason it must never be on `origin`'s push path, where it would turn
   every agent push into a half-failure.
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Build & Test

```bash
pip install -e .
pytest
```

## Architecture Overview

homemaker-layout is a Python successor to the Perl [Urb](../urb) project. It
represents a building as a binary slicing tree where leaves carry **target
dimensions** from the programme and division ratios are **solved bottom-up**
(inverting Urb's top-down approach). The evolutionary search explores topology,
types, and adjacency only.

Key modules:
- `dom.py` — read/write Urb `.dom` YAML into a `Node` tree
- `geometry.py` — faithful port of Urb's top-down geometry
- `programme.py` — parse `patterns.config` space requirements
- `solver.py` — bottom-up ratio solve (scipy)
- `shapecurve.py` — Otten/Stockmeyer shape-curve DP: exact size/width/proportion feasibility for a frozen topology, any storey count (DESIGN.md §37.2/§37.4-§37.6); used as `driver._evaluate`'s NM warm-start/hard pre-filter
- `cpsat.py` — exact room-code-to-leaf labelling via OR-Tools CP-SAT for a fixed topology (DESIGN.md §37.7); replaces `operators._assign_adjacency_aware`'s greedy/beam room placement behind `assign_solver="cpsat"`, and powers the `operators.mutate_reassign` in-search repair operator
- `fitness.py` — native Python fitness evaluator (replaces Perl oracle)
- `fitness_cmd.py` — `homemaker-fitness` CLI entry point
- `collapse_cmd.py` — `homemaker-collapse` CLI: finish-time global cell→room collapse (94g)
- `graph.py` — leaf-adjacency graph for programme-driven fitness checks
- `genome.py` — topology genome: base-floor tree + per-storey deltas
- `operators.py` — high-locality mutation and subtree crossover
- `innerloop.py` — ratio optimisation inner loop (Nelder-Mead / CMA-ES)
- `driver.py` — memetic search outer loop
- `evolve.py` — `homemaker-evolve` CLI entry point
- `bubble.py` — 3D bubble-diagram adjacency fitness-signal prototype (DESIGN.md §27, `mi7`); validated NULL, not wired into `fitness.py` — reference only, do not build on without a new formulation

## Conventions & Patterns

### Scoring .dom files

Use the native `homemaker-fitness` command. Like the old `urb-fitness.pl`, you
**must `cd` to the directory containing the `.dom` file first** — the tool
resolves `patterns.config`, `costs.config`, and writes `.score`/`.fails`
relative to `cwd`:

```bash
cd /home/bruno/src/homemaker-layout/examples/programme-house
homemaker-fitness cf0b8a77e8b2325f92a7e7d150184a55.dom
```

The score is written to `<file>.dom.score` and failures to `<file>.dom.fails`; the numeric score is also printed to stderr.

`fitness.py` is the **only** evaluator. The Perl oracle it was ported from —
`oracle.py`, `urb-fitness.pl`, and the parity tests against them — is gone
(DESIGN.md §39.21). Those parity tests had never actually run: no oracle
`.score` was ever committed, so on a clean checkout every case skipped, and the
only cases that ever executed compared the native scorer with itself (§39.20).

The corollary matters when reading the objective: a constant or a rule that
looks odd is **not** thereby validated by "Urb did it this way". Several
defects found in §39 were carried straight over from the Perl — see §39.19 on
`value_supported`, and `homemaker-py-hxi` on circulation, which the owner has
ruled needs fixing.
